  Abstract                 = {Median filter was long known in image processing for its high computational costs. Recently, an algorithm was developed which is able to compute median on integer-valued images in a roughly constant average time. A new O(1) algorithm presented here further improves the aforementioned one, being at the time of writing the lowest theoretical complexity algorithm for calculation of 2D and higher dimensional median filters. The algorithm scales naturally to higher precision (e.g. 16-bit) integer data without any modifications. Its adaptive version offers additional speed-up for images showing compact modes in gray-value distribution. The algorithm will be useful for high bit depth data or on hardware without SIMD extensions. A C/C++ implementation is available under GPL for research purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {Dust particles immersed within a plasma environment, such as those found in planetary rings or cometary environments, will acquire an electric charge. If the ratio of interparticle potential energy to average kinetic energy is high enough the particles will form either a ‘liquid’ structure with short-range ordering or a crystalline structure with long-range ordering. Since their discovery in laboratory environments in 1994, such crystals have been the subject of a variety of experimental, theoretical, and numerical investigations. Laboratory experiments analyzing the behavior of dust grains in a plasma rely on optical diagnostics to provide data about the system in a non-perturbative manner. In the past, capturing, imaging, and analyzing crystalline structure in dusty plasmas has been a non-trivial problem. Utilizing digital imaging and analysis systems, data capture, image formatting, and analysis can be done quickly. Following data capture, image analysis is conducted using modified Particle Image Velocimetry and Particle Tracking Velocimetry algorithms. The data extracted is then used to construct Voronoi diagrams, calculate particle density, inter-particle spacing, pair correlation functions, and thermal energy. From this data other dust plasma parameters can be inferred such as inter-particle forces and grain charges.},

  Abstract                 = {When tracking a target particle that is interacting with nearest neighbors in a known way, positional data of the neighbors can be used to improve the state estimate. Effects of the accuracy of such positional data on the target track accuracy are investigated in this paper, in the context of dusty plasmas. In kinematic simulations, notable improvement in the target track accuracy was found when including all nearest neighbors in the state estimation filter and tracking algorithm, whereas the track accuracy was not significantly improved by higher-accuracy measurement techniques. The state estimation algorithm, involving an extended Kalman filter, was shown to either remove or significantly reduce errors due to "pixel-locking". For the purposes of determining the precise particle locations, it is concluded that the simplified state estimation algorithm can be a viable alternative to using more computationally-intensive measurement techniques.},
