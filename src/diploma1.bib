  title = {Tracking interacting dust: comparison of tracking and state estimation
	techniques for dusty plasmas},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {7698},
  abstract = {When tracking a target particle that is interacting with nearest neighbors
	in a known way, positional data of the neighbors can be used to improve
	the state estimate. Effects of the accuracy of such positional data
	on the target track accuracy are investigated in this paper, in the
	context of dusty plasmas. In kinematic simulations, notable improvement
	in the target track accuracy was found when including all nearest
	neighbors in the state estimation filter and tracking algorithm,
	whereas the track accuracy was not significantly improved by higher-accuracy
	measurement techniques. The state estimation algorithm, involving
	an extended Kalman filter, was shown to either remove or significantly
	reduce errors due to "pixel-locking". For the purposes of determining
	the precise particle locations, it is concluded that the simplified
	state estimation algorithm can be a viable alternative to using more
	computationally-intensive measurement techniques.},
