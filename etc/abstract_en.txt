dusty plasma, plasma, particle detecting, image processing, OpenCL, GPGPU


In my thesis I show the apparatus of the dusty plasma's experiment.
During the experiment the particles are in crystal structure and photos are taken of them with high speed camera.
Processing these images will result the particle's position and the system's statistical quantities.

Than I describe the detection of the particles using filtering and adaptive decision level.
Instead of using the common FIR Gauss filter I implement the more effective median filter.
For computing the particle's position I implement the momentum method, which take more steps but one can achieve sub-pixel resolution.

After I overview the OpenCL framework, which is used for parallel programming.
Using this statements and the available device's properties I composed the program's steps.
These steps are investigated for achieving faster run time.
I benchmark the program's run time on CPU, on GPU and on many integrated core card.
Finally I put the program inside the image acquiring softver of the high speed camera for online processing.
